/* This do-file:
*Computes sample size and effect size for a given power and treatment to control size ratio
*Includes variations with controls, clusters and take-up rate 
*Uses the Balsakhi dataset to illustrate how to calculate power

About the data: The Balsakhi program was a remedial education program that was conducted in Indian schools to increase literacy and numeracy skills. 
You can learn more about the Balsakhi dataset from the documentation and data here at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UV7ERB

Variables:
- Outcome of interest is in the "normalised total score." This is represented by: 
	- "pre_totnorm" at baseline
	- "post_totnorm" at the endline
- Treatment: bal
	- 0=control
	- 1=treatment
- Clustering variable (by school): divid

Note: key inputs for calculating power like the mean and the standard deviation at baseline, ICC, etc. are calculated 
using the specified dataset, but they can also be specified manually.

About the file:
- This file contains sample code for the following:
	0. Housekeeping and load data
	1. No covariates
		1a. Sample size for a given effect size
		1b. MDE for a given sample size
	2. With covariates (not applicable for binary data)
		2a. Sample size for a specified effect - with covariates 
		2b. MDE for a given sample size - with covariates
	3. Sample size with Partial Take-up
	4. Overview of how MDE and sample size change as we add covariates and take-up changes
	5. Clustered designs
		5a. Compute number of clusters for a given effect size and size of cluster 
		5b. Compute cluster size given the number of clusters and effect size 
		5c. Compute effect size for a given cluster size and number of clusters

- With the exception of module 4, each module is self-contained and can be run on its own after running module 0
- To use this file for your own power calculations, change the dataset/variables/values marked as "SPECIFY" 


** Binary outcome variable: 

This code assumes a continuous outcome. If the outcome variable is a binary variable, use the "power twoproportions" command.
- The baseline mean is the proportion of 1s in the outcome variable 
- The effect size is the change in the treatment of the proportion of the outcome variable from the control group 
- Standard deviation is a function of the proportion of the outcome variable in the control dataset
- Documentation can be found by typing "help power twoproportions" or "help power twoproportions cluster"

The section on covariates is not applicable to binary outcome variables due to the different model specification for binary variables. 
See McConnell and Vera-Hernandez (2015) (https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/wps/WP201517_update_Sep15.pdf)
for a discussion of how the power calculations change with covariates when the outcome variable is binary.

****************************************************************************************
********************************* 2. Adding covariates *********************************
****************************************************************************************

/* To see how potential controls affect power,  we would ideally have access to a sample data set 
(e.g. historical or pilot data). With these data, we would want to:
	1. Regress Y_i (the outcome) on X_i (the controls) 
	2. Use the residual standard deviation of the outcome variable from this regression to evaluate 
	how much variance is explained by the set of covariates we plan to include
		- In practice, this residual SD becomes the new SD we include in our parametric power calculations

With access to historical data, for example, this would involve regressing last year's test scores 
on test scores from the year before. Using balsakhi data, this would be as follows. 

Note that this section is not applicable for power calculations with a binary outcome variable. 
See McConnell and Vera-Hernandez 2015 (https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/wps/WP201517_update_Sep15.pdf)
